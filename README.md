# MysteryOfLodenberg

This Repository is made for the creation of the game Mystery Of Londenberg.

The Game was created in the Unity Game Engine and the scripts used were all created by our team members.

In the Assets folder are added the Assets/Tilepacks that are used in the game. Some of them might changed, after some editing in photoshop, but most of them are left as is. Also the scripts used in Unity are added.

In the Mystery Of Londenberg Final Version (With Revisions) folder, there is the whole Unity Project. In it there are the Assets, Tilepacks/Tilemaps, Scripts, Fonts, Animations and everything that we used to create the game in the Unity Engine. (Note: The Project is on a 7Zip file, because there are some contents of the project that are unable to be uploaded).

In the Mystery OF Londeberg Game folder, there is the application for the game to run, outside of the project.

In the Files folder, there are the files that had been created from the day the project launched till the last day of it. (From the files like Software Requirements Specification, to files that used to create the story of the game.

The credits for the Assets and the Tilesets are respectfully mentioned into the credits scene of the game.

The music of the game was created by Elgelon and the story was inspired after Agatha Christies story "The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd", but many of the story points changed, so it can help us, as a team and respect Agatha's wish to not let her books come to life.
